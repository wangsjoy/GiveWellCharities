with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs, or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations. Use of the Software and
Documentation is made with the understanding that PayPal will not provide you
with any technical or customer support or maintenance. Some states or

CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. PAYPAL'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND
THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION.

cease use and distribution of the Software and Documentation as soon as

without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof. If any part of this
Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of
the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable

shall be brought in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA.
